	* LICENSE: license copied from s-code.lisp.

	* Makefile: a maintenance makefile.  This is enough to put series
	in Qicklisp's local-projects.  It's *not* intended to build it.

	* old/: move old ChangLog, MK defsystem, RELEASE-NOTES to old, as
	they're hopelessly out of date.

	* s-code.lisp (install-series): add and use install-series.  This
	is a trivial wrapper for install, but it's exported from the
	SERIES package.  install still exists because people will use it,
	and it's still not exported because (I assume) it's too general a
	name.  But at least now it's possible to set series up without
	relying on internal symbols.

	* s-test.lisp (test-opt-&-non-opt): read more safely.

	* s-test.lisp (#:series/tests): tests are now in their own package
	rather than crapping all over CL-USER.  Changes to ASDF definition
	for this.

	* series.asd ("series", "series/tests"): an initial attempt to
	update things for recent ASDF.  The description &c are now
	probably fairly wrong.  sysdcl.lisp is a symlink to series.asd
	which I use for my :sysdcl command.
